Annotations to Harry Garrood's [A Guide to the PureScript Numeric Hierarchy](https://a-guide-to-the-purescript-numeric-hierarchy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Published at https://annotated-a-guide-to-the-purescript-numeric-hierarchy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To build from this repo on Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo apt install python3-sphinx
$ make html
```

> ## Status
> 
> This guide is currently in a beta stage.
> 
> ReadTheDocs builds the HTML from what's in the `published` branch; the `master`
> branch will often be slightly ahead of `published`, containing material that
> I feel is not quite ready to be published yet.
> 
> If you read through an earlier version of this guide and want to see what has
> changed in the meantime, there is a [changelog](changelog.md). There is also
> GitHub's [compare
> view](https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time/). For
> example, [this view compares what's in the `published` branch now with what
> `published` looked like 2 days
> ago](https://github.com/hdgarrood/purescript-numeric-hierarchy-guide/compare/published@%7B2day%7D...published).

> ## Working on this locally
> 
> *this is really just a note for me, please see the above paragraph re:
> contributions*
> 
> Compiled using Sphinx. I have been developing on Ubuntu using the default
> version from the Ubuntu repositories; install like this:
> 
> ```
> $ sudo apt install python3-sphinx
> ```
> 
> At the time of writing, on Ubuntu 16.04, this gets you Sphinx v1.3.6. The
> hosting is done by Read The Docs; I'm not sure what version of Sphinx they're
> using, but it seems to work fine between both environments.
> 
> To rebuild, change to the project directory and run:
> 
> ```
> $ make html
> ```
> 
> The html will be written to the `_build` directory; I recommend spinning up a
> simple HTTP server in there to use whilst developing. The npm package `serve`
> can provide this.
